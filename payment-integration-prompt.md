Prompt ‚Äî Payment Integration for Modern School Management System (Bangladesh Focused)

Goal:
Integrate a secure, unified payment system into the existing Laravel + React + Tailwind School Management System to handle student fees, registration charges, exam fees, and donations.
The system should support Bangladeshi banks, local wallets (bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay, Cellfin) and international cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, UnionPay, Google Pay).

üéØ Objectives

Allow students, parents, or admins to pay any school-related fees online.

Support both domestic and international payment methods.

Provide instant payment confirmation, transaction history, and refund handling.

Integrate with a popular payment aggregator that connects to all major Bangladeshi gateways.

Ensure security, PCI-DSS compliance, and proper webhook handling.

All payments must be recorded in the system‚Äôs accounting module (fees, invoices, receipts).

‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack & Tools

Backend: Laravel 10+ (API)

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Payment SDKs:

SSLCommerz API (Primary ‚Äì supports Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, UnionPay, bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay, Cellfin, etc.)

Alternative fallback: AamarPay or ShurjoPay (optional)

Webhook handling: Laravel event listeners or jobs

Notifications: Laravel Mail + in-app notifications

Database: MySQL

PDF Invoices: laravel-dompdf or Snappy

Instant approval after successful payment.

Exam Fees

2. Payment Gateways Integration
a. SSLCommerz (Primary)

Use SSLCommerz Hosted Checkout (redirect method) for PCI compliance.

API Endpoints:

POST /api/payments/initiate

POST /api/payments/verify

POST /api/payments/webhook

Capture all response data: tran_id, amount, currency, card_type, store_id, val_id, etc.

Save payment log in DB (payments table).

b. Alternative Gateways (Optional)

Integrate AamarPay or ShurjoPay as backup gateways.

Allow switching between gateways from admin settings.

3. Payment Flow
Step 1: Generate Invoice

Admin or system auto-generates an invoice ‚Üí stored in invoices table with status = pending.

Step 2: Initiate Payment

User (student/parent) clicks ‚ÄúPay Now‚Äù ‚Üí React frontend calls POST /api/payments/initiate with invoice ID.

Step 3: Redirect to Gateway

Laravel backend creates transaction record and redirects to SSLCommerz hosted page.

Step 4: Payment Confirmation

After successful payment, SSLCommerz calls the callback URL ‚Üí Laravel verifies via val_id and updates the invoice as paid.

Step 5: Frontend Updates

React dashboard refreshes ‚Üí shows success message, downloadable receipt, and sends an email confirmation.

Step 6: Webhook Events

Handle webhook for asynchronous confirmations and reconciliation.
